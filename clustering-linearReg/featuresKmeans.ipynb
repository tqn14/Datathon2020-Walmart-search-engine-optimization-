The granulated formula simple to apply and dissolves fast, and the easy pour application bag makes this a simpler, faster solution compared to Muriatic Acid or HTH Balancer Pods. High pH can cause dry, itchy skin and hard-to-remove scale on pool surfaces. Use Clorox Pool&Spa pH Down as needed to achieve a suitable range of 7.2 to 7.6 to keep your water swim-ready and clear. Intended for use in traditional chlorine and salt chlorine pools. Before use, test and balance your pool weekly with the Clorox Pool app to maintain clear water, longer lasting equipment, and comfortable swimming.

       " \"Enjoy sparkling clean hot tub water without the odor of combined chlorine. Spa Selections Bromine Tablets not only disinfect and sanitize hot tub and spa water, but they also create a soft water feel for maximum relaxation. Unlike chlorine, bromine is effective over a wider pH range, has less odor, and it won't bleach bathing suits. Best of all, Spa Selections Bromine Tablets fit all floaters. In addition to changing hot tub water every 90 days (or more frequently with more use), proper sanitary practices include shocking the spa after every use – especially if there are several bathers within a 24-hour period. Before using Spa Selections Bromine Tablets for the first time, add 0.5 ounces of Spa Selections Brom-Start per 100 gallons of water to establish a 30-ppm bromide concentration. Whenever the spa or hot tub is drained and refilled, add sodium bromide at this dosage to help establish an all-bromide system. This eliminates chlorine odors and maximizes skin and eye comfort. Do not re-enter treated spas when water has bromine levels above 8 ppm as this could cause bodily injury. Ingredients: Active Ingredients: C1-bromo-3-chloro-5,5-dimenthylhydantoin 54.2%, 1,3-dichloro-5,5-dimethylhydantoin 28.9% 1,3-dichloro-5-ethyl-5-methylhydantoin 15.9% Other Ingredients: 1% Bromine tablets disinfect hot tub and spa water without the smell of chlorine bleach Get the most out of a hot tub experience when enjoying sparkling clean water with low odor and a soft water feel Bromine shock is effective over a wider pH range, and won't irritate eyes or bleach bathing suits Spa Selections Bromine Tablets for hot tubs and spas fit all floaters For best results, add half an ounce per 100 gallons, once weekly or after each use Formulated to be as effective as chlorine, but without the chlorine smell Sanitizes hot tubs and spas while helping to keep water odor free and sparkling clean\",\n",
